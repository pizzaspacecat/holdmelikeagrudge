          <h3>June 16th, 2025</h3>
          <p> i relive my worst moment with you every month without fail.
            it lives in my body and i think thats really special but also really fucked up and i dont think any amount of apologizing or forgiveness you give me could amend it for me
            i love you for taking care of me, you shoudnt have had to do that. you shouldnt have had to listen to my humiliation. i will forever love you for that but i am sorry it happened
            that was a pivital moment in my life and in a fucked up way, im glad it was you that witnessed it.
            i like to think my life started when i met you. we practically grew up together and i like that instead of the reality of my childhood up until that point. and its my life so i choose whatever the fuck i want Ok.
i really like my life with you in it. big fan of yours. i had a point with this but im just rambling now. just know i really love you forever and ever you are my best friend and life partner

              <h3>June 18th, 2025</h3>
              <p> ok i think i know what i want to do with my life thanks to a youtube comment a former friend left on my channel 4 years ago
                i vaguely remember why they said what they said. i think i was unintentionally an asshole. i need to change. i was reading back on old discord arguments (as one does) and i need to change for myself
                nothing anyone said is influencing my decision i just dont like that version of myself i think the version i am now is very awesome and i want everyone who decides to check back up on me to see that
                so im changing. my online persona. into something i want to be proud of i think im going to take more pictures upload more videos be more personal... i could really gaf
                im proud of who i am this is me yes i am cringe yes i leave the house maybe 2 times a month if im unemployed yes i have no direction to where im going in Life
                but i have love. i know what i love. i know WHO i love. i always loved reading about other people's personal lives on their old blogs from the 2000's. i would read a fanfic, go to their profile, stalk them online and just get to know them
                through their blogs and i hold that really close to my heart. i want people to experience that with me i want my life to be out there i want people to experience the world from my POV because when im gone, thats gone as well. 
                check out my youtube!! im uploading videos i take from shows i go to in the scene in houston !

         <h3>June 19th, 2025</h3>
         <p>i want to make an update log for the "currently listening" section because it does take some effort to convert the music into mp4 
and then exporting them to catbox so i can embed it into my site...and also i think the guestbook is too hidden but i like the space it covers.. idk?
i just want people to write in my guestbook i guess. i also want people to visit my site but also not visit it because its kind of embarassing
i already showed one friend (hi johnnie) and i want to die. anywyas hello world! i am feeling very conflicted. i really like people, especially NEW people, talking to me
and starting convos but its just nervewracking idk why. i am so socially drained talking to people is hard!!!!!! but its cool because i am discovering people around me
are obsessed with fall out boy. also just knocked a couple things off my to do list and im feeling #fire. still thinking about those discord arguments tho. like wow
2023 was rough. looking back on it, i understand where they were coming from but at the same time i do not think the issue was that serious but that is discord culture for you..
im still thinking about it because one of the topics in that argument was my college plans and my friend johnnie (hi again) asked if i was still in uni and it got me thinking. call me an avg self centered amaerican but i noticed
that every non american just says uni ALWAYS when referring to a higher education. like university here is so fucking expensive i am NOT going to uni anytime soon i am on a free ride to community college,
thank you pell grant! for any non american reading this: community college is a 2 year institution where you get a lesser degree but its half the price of any university and sometimes you can
get in for free if your family is poor enough. idk what that has to do with anything i was talking about but yea. just Thinking.... and i still havent moved out lol i dont see myself moving out for a long time bc of this economy.
so i guess my life plans right now are finish community college finish emt course maybe study a bit work as an emt for awhile then study to become a paramedic because i wanted to become a firefighter BUT
i would need to workout for that... like rlly badly... more than i would ever need to workout as an emt/paramedic....and i dont think im just cut out for the firefighter lifestyle sorry. 
my emo cousin (which i should probably talk to) idk if he's emo he has the emo bangs and he shops at hot topic but he mostly listens to nu metal? u rock julian. anyway he's also going 
into the medical field and people tell us we look alike? i dont think we do but we do have similar interests i had beef with him for most of my life because of a misunderstanding and a grudge he had against me
but my mom told his mom that im emo so all was forgiven my sophmore year. he's also a trans ally so shoutout to him. my sister studied to become a nurse for awhile so i feel like im falling into her 
footsteps a bit and it makes me ANGRY. i could just choose not to become anything in the medical field and walk away but its calling to me .... i never imagined i would end up here
geology didnt work out for me btw folks who know... its sad but im letting go and im much happier studying as an emt. also is the green text too hard to read? lmk in the guestbook HEH. 
ok im logging off im basically just rambling

         <p>feeling: loved. happy. tipsy on life. cheesy. by the way is it normal for friends to introduce you to other friends? i dont know multiple people have asked me
to introduce them to my other friends. online people too... never crosses my mind.. i understand wanting to introduce my partner to my friends but my friends meeting my friends never crosses my path of thinking.
id like to show off ray to all my friends tho one day that i understand bc ray is ray and i love ray ok. anyways had a really good time gonna post a video to my youtube
its just me and my bff sitting in the taco bell parking lot also might redo my site need to add more things to it might make guestbook more prevaliant or however u spell taat
