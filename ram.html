<h3>July 14th, 2025</h3>
<p>saying and believing you can be better than those before you is easier than actually being better. my family is so complex, we are not normal by any means.
we are the most abnormal generation ever. i've tried to be better to and for my nephew but it is really hard. i dont know how to unlearn the behaviors i experienced as a child.
my siblings would ignore me and wouldn't pay attention to me they would be uncomfortable around me and uncomfortable with affection. so, in turn, i became uncomfortable with showing affection
and giving it out. it's easier with friends, people who are non familial, but im still struggling. i cry every time i have to give affection. i dont know how to show that to my nephew, who doesnt even seem to care.
its hard. i know him because i remember being a child begging for attention from my family. i get him. but now ive turned into my family, im annoyed by it. 
the way he looks at me makes me want to crawl in a hole. i havent spoken about this but my mom has definitely noticed. my sister started this chain, she was the one
that was uncomfortable and was cruel to my brother and then when i came along, he was cruel to me for no reason. i havent repeated that to my nephew
but i just feel bothered by his presence sometimes. he loves me so much without even knowing me, he wants to be in my room all the time, he plays pranks
on me even though i barely spend time with him. he grabs my hand and leads me places he grabs my hand when he's upset. i dont understand it i dont understand my behavior and i probably wont for a long time.
 i love him so much but im afraid to show it because someone else might hear me and he knows. this can be said for many people in my life.
people may think i wear my heart on my sleeve, maybe i do, but it's unintentional. i really cannot give out affection easily it's like pulling teeth. 
i got interrupted writing this because my dan and phil photocard came in the mail (WHAT!!!!) and omgogmogmogmg im so excited ok forget everything i said here
im not emo

        <p>you know if you have any personality disorder, that doesnt absolve you from all wrong doing.
omfg. like take accountability if you're going to split on someone u fucking know u can feel it just try your best and make amends. it is not hard to say sorry.
but to justify every wrongdoing is so fucked up. im so mad right now remembering. i hate you so much
and i hope one day you and everyone around you realizes what a fucking asshole you are. you knocked me down to your level because you couldnt stand to see me stand above you.
you always do this.
you need serious help but you will never get it because you are afraid of changing and i hope that everyone leaves you 5 years from now and you're still as pathetic
 as you are now.
go ahead and make fun of this too, if you see it. go make it your desktop background. it's nice to see i still have a hold over you. 
anyways, show on friday will record. hope it'll be fun.. no car accidents in the whataburger drive thru this time.
