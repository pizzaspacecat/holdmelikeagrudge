            and i dont know how much longer i can handle this i cant keep accommodating to everyone else i just want to be happy
            im not happy i dont know how or what to change i have so many good things but im not happy
            why cant i just do things????? he observed that when i dont understand something i put all my force into figuring it out 
            thats something i can appreaciate and the only thing im taking away from that relationship but right now that doesnt fit me
            i cant figure out whats wrong with me and im so worn out i cant attempt to understand</p>

          <h3>June 16th, 2025</h3>
          <p> i relive my worst moment with you every month without fail.
            it lives in my body and i think thats really special but also really fucked up and i dont think any amount of apologizing or forgiveness you give me could amend it for me
            i love you for taking care of me, you shoudnt have had to do that. you shouldnt have had to listen to my humiliation. i will forever love you for that but i am sorry it happened
            that was a pivital moment in my life and in a fucked up way, im glad it was you that witnessed it.
            i like to think my life started when i met you. we practically grew up together and i like that instead of the reality of my childhood up until that point. and its my life so i choose whatever the fuck i want Ok.
i really like my life with you in it. big fan of yours. i had a point with this but im just rambling now. just know i really love you forever and ever you are my best friend and life partner

              <h3>June 18th, 2025</h3>
              <p> ok i think i know what i want to do with my life thanks to a youtube comment a former friend left on my channel 4 years ago
                i vaguely remember why they said what they said. i think i was unintentionally an asshole. i need to change. i was reading back on old discord arguments (as one does) and i need to change for myself
                nothing anyone said is influencing my decision i just dont like that version of myself i think the version i am now is very awesome and i want everyone who decides to check back up on me to see that
                so im changing. my online persona. into something i want to be proud of i think im going to take more pictures upload more videos be more personal... i could really gaf
                im proud of who i am this is me yes i am cringe yes i leave the house maybe 2 times a month if im unemployed yes i have no direction to where im going in Life
                but i have love. i know what i love. i know WHO i love. i always loved reading about other people's personal lives on their old blogs from the 2000's. i would read a fanfic, go to their profile, stalk them online and just get to know them
                through their blogs and i hold that really close to my heart. i want people to experience that with me i want my life to be out there i want people to experience the world from my POV because when im gone, thats gone as well. 
                check out my youtube!! im uploading videos i take from shows i go to in the scene in houston !
