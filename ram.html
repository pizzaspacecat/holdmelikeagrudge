          <h3>June 24th, 2025</h3>
          <p> stop me from placing ebay bids im shaking so bad im still not over it my account had my moms card connected to it too im shaking so bad
i accidentally bid $11k on an item because i wanted to be speedy and i think the auction restarted because i retracted my bid and i feel so bad im so sorry
i want to cry i feel so much guilt im so dizzy and sick to my stomach im so sorry i bid on another item though i hope this one turns out better.. also ive
been having so much good luck in animal jam and i was just thinking wow what is terrible thing is going to happen to me ?? because it was just too good to be true
well now i know. ive been having a nightmarish night. auditory hallucinations r haunting me and im scared shitless and the ebay bid did not make me feel better</p>

<p> i should make a little playlist for you guys of song recs what i have under "listening to" is supposed to function as that but i dont think its very
effective idk. le sigh le sigh more things to procrastinate. ive been chipping away at everything very slowly and im satisfied with my progress. i really want to stretch my ears
but its complicated for me to understand. i think im just a little stupid in the head i got dropped a lot throughout my life. and choked out. a lot of people like choking me
i dont know why. i went out with someone who choked me in 8th grade. i think that says a lot about me than it does about them. then my best friend dated him and i had to pretend i was happy for him.
awkkkwarddddddd. i think my dating history is pretty pathetic. i say no more! then i go and attach myself to a white man with anger issues. not everyone ive dated fits
this description but yea.. its complicated, much like stretching my ears. im trying to be better, for me and my future partners.. if i have any.. 
i really like the label aroace i think it really fits me i think i just get really attached to people because of my own personal issues and then i just get lost in it
and its hard to find my way out i lose myself i dont know who i am when im in a relationship i become the person im dating its always refreshing when i get out because
i get to discover who i am again and breathe but there was one instance where that didnt happen, i actually felt like myself before during and after our relationship it was weird.
but i didnt get too far before hopping into another one lol. i had to edit this like 2 times bc 1. dropped as a baby 5 times... 2. i havent slept i fell asleep at 10? 11?pm and woke up at 2 am and i am brain dead.

<h3>June 27th, 2025</h3>
        <p>there has been something going on in my head for well over a year now. there is always something going on in there, always will be, fork in kitchen whatever.
but this is different this is something ive know about for awhile but never expressed to anyone else. i just want to get it out there
because this is my website and this is my memorial this is the handprint i want on my record i hate when people assume things about me
i cant be shy if i want to represent myself. there are so many things wrong with me if i got into them we'd be here for weeks. 
i try my hardest to just ignore it and go on with my day i say im fine and i run i am always running from something that nobody else can see
i think im loveable, maybe. lots of people are in love with the idea of me i have no clue what that entails. i go through states of not knowing who or what i am
and some days im so sure of it. i go through phases of wanting to expel every thought and resurfacing memories into the public eye. so someone can share the burden with me
i dont know how to talk to people i dont know how to put the words in my head into words until its 3 am and i havent slept and ive listened to too much fall out boy and car seat headrest
im so filled with want and i dont deserve any of it im so filled with anger and regret and i want revenge i want sommeone to do it for me so i wont have bloody hands.
but also i dont care at all about revenge, not really at all. 
i have so much good things going on it makes me anxious im not used to good things like this. i spent my youth locked in my room with only my thoughts to keep me company
i spent school days so desperate for any affection or companionship i would cut and bleed for it. i would put my head in their hands and watch as they cut out my heart and stomped on it
i liked being choked and hit because i got the attention of my peers for once. i liked it so much because it was a new experience and something so normal. i saw it in movies all the time
it was proof i was a normal kid. because if its in movies it must be normal. my life has to be like a movie. if im not in a relationship if im not going out with friends
if i dont have a best friend if i dont have cool instagram photos or an online presence at all, im not real. im not living. i am that child stuck in his room clawing at his own skin. 
sometimes i think thats who i am, that child. sometimes i think im the eager and desperate "manwhore" my mom told me i was when i was 12. sometimes i think im the stupid lovesick teenager 
hiding in discord chats all day. sometimes i think im me who cuts his own hair, has piercings, has so many lovely friends and a soulmate, goes out to bars and concerts and conventions. its all ive ever wanted.
i feel so guilty i have survivors guilt i see others around me who are stuck in their own rooms and i want to claw and get them out. and i feel like i dont deserve the life ive carved out for myself.
i dont deserve it. i feel so comfortable in my dark room with nobody at all to check up on me. i craved it. sometimes i still do i go in these episodes where i'll only lift my head up for ray.
i am the way i am because i cherish every human interaction i get, for the kid who only had himself and objects. 
i get so overwhelmed with the amount of people talking to me in dms or by new followers or even just by my regular friends indirectly showing how much they care. its too much
i dont know how to deal with it. i split i lash out i hide i run i dont know how to fix it it takes me forever to muster up the words or discover why im acting like this 
i am okay because this is all ive known ive dealt with this since i was born ive learned to live with it someday i'll part with it and that scares me
because i dont want to lose that kid inside me.
