          <h3>June 24th, 2025</h3>
          <p> stop me from placing ebay bids im shaking so bad im still not over it my account had my moms card connected to it too im shaking so bad
i accidentally bid $11k on an item because i wanted to be speedy and i think the auction restarted because i retracted my bid and i feel so bad im so sorry
i want to cry i feel so much guilt im so dizzy and sick to my stomach im so sorry i bid on another item though i hope this one turns out better.. also ive
been having so much good luck in animal jam and i was just thinking wow what is terrible thing is going to happen to me ?? because it was just too good to be true
well now i know. ive been having a nightmarish night. auditory hallucinations r haunting me and im scared shitless and the ebay bid did not make me feel better</p>

<p> i should make a little playlist for you guys of song recs what i have under "listening to" is supposed to function as that but i dont think its very
effective idk. le sigh le sigh more things to procrastinate. ive been chipping away at everything very slowly and im satisfied with my progress. i really want to stretch my ears
but its complicated for me to understand. i think im just a little stupid in the head i got dropped a lot throughout my life. and choked out. a lot of people like choking me
i dont know why. i went out with someone who choked me in 8th grade. i think that says a lot about me than it does about them. then my best friend dated him and i had to pretend i was happy for him.
awkkkwarddddddd. i think my dating history is pretty pathetic. i say no more! then i go and attach myself to a white man with anger issues. not everyone ive dated fits
this description but yea.. its complicated, much like stretching my ears. im trying to be better, for me and my future partners.. if i have any.. 
i really like the label aroace i think it really fits me i think i just get really attached to people because of my own personal issues and then i just get lost in it
and its hard to find my way out i lose myself i dont know who i am when im in a relationship i become the person im dating its always refreshing when i get out because
i get to discover who i am again and breathe but there was one instance where that didnt happen, i actually felt like myself before during and after our relationship it was weird.
but i didnt get too far before hopping into another one lol. i had to edit this like 2 times bc 1. dropped as a baby 5 times... 2. i havent slept i fell asleep at 10? 11?pm and woke up at 2 am and i am brain dead.

<h3>June 27th, 2025</h3>
        <p>there has been something going on in my head for well over a year now. there is always something going on in there, always will be, fork in kitchen whatever.
but this is different this is something ive know about for awhile but never expressed to anyone else. i just want to get it out there
because this is my website and this is my memorial this is the handprint i want on my record i hate when people assume things about me
i cant be shy if i want to represent myself. there are so many things wrong with me if i got into them we'd be here for weeks. 
i try my hardest to just ignore it and go on with my day i say im fine and i run i am always running from something that nobody else can see
thats one of the reasons why all my relationships fail because i just keep everything bottled up and i explode. like a soda can. i feel like
im not me i am me but im arguing with myself and i dont remember things and i dont know the truth of what happened i dont know how to hold
myself responsible i dont know what was manipulation lies splitting or delusions i really dont know and i feel so much guilt towards 
everyone. im not blaming anyone but i was really messed up i was splitting i was dealing with the situation in my head after months. i wasnt
over it. sorry i lied to you about that. i lied a lot. but it didnt even matter if i lied, you didnt like each other and you didnt show him
any ounce of grace. at the time, this i do remember so maybe that says something about me i remember
my thoughts more clearly than i remember memories which is weird. so maybe i do know who i am and what my stance is. but i remember thinking
no way in hell am i dropping my best friend of 5 years right after he poured his heart to me after everything we've been through and he's currently
going through and im just going to say whatever i need to appease you and get you back down.
i have the messages right here btw im gonna copy and paste because i did back up every message we ever sent to each other because i knew.
i Knew i would forget and i would misremember i said to you " i handle stuff like this in my own way ur just going to have to trust me"
and i think everyone needs to hear that. this is something that i have with no other person, i just know my best friend inside and out. 
i know how he's going to react to things, i know how he's going to handle them how long he's going to take to respond. I Know and im right every time.
it seriously pisses me off that people dont understand or believe me i prove myself right every time. they write me off as crazy because he's my favorite person
maybe he is my favorite person for a reason. i am so stable around him i definitely didnt feel this way around you. he's a constant he never changes
i feel safe around him he isnt unpredictable i know him even though i dont know everything about him. i never gave myself time to actually just think so here i am thinking and reminiscing.
it feels like there was this weird pause in my life and i feel SO WEIRD!!! this is the thing ive been running from. i let myself go and i entered a time warp and now im dizzy and disorientated
and i have a lot of feelings i dont know what to do with. i focus a lot on my best friend because its so weird. he pulled me out and i feel like i havent seen him in forever mostly because i havent. or at all.
because he lives far away. and we've been through so much fucking shit. oh my goddd. he is my home and i come crawling back wounded every time. 
sorry this is probably really gay im sorry its june ok no more after this theres 3 more days left. but he really was the catalyst. he bridged the gap. thank youuuuuuu u always do and im sorry
but i think thats just a thing friends do for each other sometimes i think about myself and i feel bad you deal with all my problems i forget you have problems that i "deal" w too.
the street goes both ways..... so maybe i dont need to apologize. if everyone has given up on me i will always crawl back into your arms and i know you think the same. 
its weird going back to normal after someone made you believe they wanted to marry you this year. a bit weird. a lotta weird. it made me scared when he proposed it. i knew i wanted to 
EVENTUALLY do that but like. in 2025? i was only just 18 i have so much i need to do explore i was scared and uncertain and im so glad im not married to that person. thank fucking god.
im running the other way if someone says that to me now. because yes i have bpd yes im so obsessive (not rlly. im just mean to myself, me 4 months ago would say this with confidence tho)
but i am not fucking marrying you in vegas. fuck!!!!!!! ive dealt with this before i and i dont remember how i dealt with it or stopped running. maybe because i only had one variable now i have like
5,,, god. i think im doing better though. i just needed someone to hear me out. i dont like bothering people with troubles unless i need HELP HELP! and therapy is expensive im sorry but i hope
someone who is going through the same thing can feel seen or something probably not because this is all super vague but whatever. inbox me whenever.</p>
